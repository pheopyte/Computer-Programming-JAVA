# Java programming activities to school

<p>I wrote this code as part of my computer programming major in a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology program, and I uploaded it to my GitHub repository to help other IT students or anyone else who wants to learn programming. This code represents the activities I completed in my programming course during the first semester, including the preliminary, midterm, and final exams.</p>
