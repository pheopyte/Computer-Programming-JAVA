<p>1. Comparing Answers

by CodeChum Admin

Finally, the exam is over! I think I did quite well, but I’m not very confident with my answer for number 10. I need to verify my answer.


Hey, you! Yeah, you, what’s your answer for number 10? Is it A, B, C, D, or E?


Inputs

1. Answer for number 10

This is a character value which will be either A, B, C, D, or E.


Sample Output

Enter your answer for number 10: A
Oh, my answer is A as well</p>

```
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter your answer for number 10: ");
        char input = keyboard.next().charAt(0);
        
        System.out.print("Oh, my answer is " + input + " as well");
    }
}

<p>2. John's Birthday

by CodeChum Admin

It’s John’s birthday, so Cody decided to buy John a cute little pet. He has to ask John which animal he likes though so have John input either "dog", "cat", or "eagle" then print out his choice.


Inputs

1. The animal John likes


Sample Output

Enter the animal John likes: dog
dog</p>

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the animal John likes: ");
        String choice = keyboard.nextLine();

        System.out.print(choice);
    }
}

<p>3. A Meter for Cody

by CodeChum Admin

Cody has n feet worth of wooden sticks. The problem is, Cody wasn’t designed to read measurements done in feet. Cody has to convert this into meters and read it that way instead. One foot is equivalent to 0.305 meters. Print the converted unit.


Inputs

1. Feet worth of wooden sticks

6.5

Since this is a measurement, this can be a decimal value


Sample Output

Enter measurement in feet: 6.5
Equivalent meters = 1.98

Score: 13/13</p>

```
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
		final double metersPerFoot = 0.305;

		System.out.print("Enter measurement in feet: ");
		double feet = input.nextDouble();

		double meters = feet * metersPerFoot;
        DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("0.00");
        String meterFormated = df.format(meters);

		System.out.println("Equivalent meters = " + meterFormated);
	}
}

<p>4. Cody the Berserk

by CodeChum Admin

Cody had a hard time saving The Programmer from the Hydra, so he decided to call his friends to help him cut off the heads together. This was brilliant because then the number of heads he has to cut would be far less than if he was all alone. For example, if the Hydra had 10 heads and he called 5 friends then they would each cut 2 heads. This presented a problem, however, if the Hydra had 11 heads then that meant one of them had to cut 3 heads.


Input the number of friends Cody has to call and the number of heads the Hydra currently has and then print the minimum number of heads each one of them has to cut.


Inputs

1. Number of friends


2. Number of heads


Sample Output

Enter the number of friends: 4
Enter the number of heads: 12
Minimum heads to cut per friend = 3

Score: 12/12
</p>

```
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.lang.Math;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the number of friends: ");
        int friends = keyboard.nextInt();
        
        System.out.print("Enter the number of heads: ");
        int heads = keyboard.nextInt();
        
        int answer = Math.floorDiv(heads, friends);

        System.out.println("Minimum heads to cut per friend = " + answer);
    }

A milk carton can hold 3.78 liters of milk. Each morning, a dairy farm ships cartons of milk to a local grocery store. The cost of producing one liter of milk is $0.38, and the profit of each carton of milk is $0.27.

Write a program that does the following:

a. Prompts the user to enter the total amount of milk produced in the morning

b. Outputs the number of milk cartons needed to hold milk (Round your answer to the nearest integer.)

c. Outputs the cost of producing milk

d. Outputs the profit for producing milk
